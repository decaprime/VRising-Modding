## Web Resources

- [VRising Gaming Tools](https://vrising.gaming.tools/) Easy browse for prefabs by in-game names, hit `Developer Info <\>` button to see prefab.
- [Cadrift for VRising](https://www.cadrift.net/v-rising/) Good for reviewing how certain systems work in the game. Keep in mind the territory ID numbers are off. Reference...
- [Territory ID Map](https://i.imgur.com/VkXoKwB.jpeg) Helpful for finding the correct ID for each territory
- [Coordinate/Chunk Map](https://i.imgur.com/UBmjxdG.jpeg) Helpful for at-a-glance general chunk/coordinate reference.
- [Map Icon reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FcbO8aMtH2FtSx-ntoMXjoyXhfGQkjnjzj1nkeR2Tk4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) Details about mapicon images.
- [VRising Modding GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XGdFZaBHL-c-rising) Custom GPT with access to server system queries and game prefabs. Useful for learning about C# and refining code in a VRising context, though do note AI tools should be used with caution and an understanding of their limitations.
