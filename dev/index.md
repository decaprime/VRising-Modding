# Under Construction

## Get started with the template

```bash
dotnet new vrisingmod -n YourMod --use-bloodstone --use-vcf
```

This will get you started with a mod named YourMod, using [Bloodstone](./bloodstone.md) and VCF that has a sample server command.

You can reference [open source](./open source.md) and [resources](./resources.md) for more information for now.
