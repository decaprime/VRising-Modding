# RE: 1.1 - Updated 4/27
Previous versions of mods and BepInEx do not work with the Oakveil game update. There will be an announcement in discord and versions published to Thunderstore when they are ready. We have a BepInEx release candidate that we need developers to update and test their mods with.
